# Managing Expired Events

## Overview
This document outlines the current process for managing and unpublishing expired events on our website. This procedure is a temporary workaround until a more automated solution is implemented.

## The Need
Expired events on our site continue to appear in search results, which can be misleading and unhelpful for users. To address this, we need to manually unpublish these events to remove them from the search index.

## Process for Unpublishing Events
To unpublish expired events, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Utility Page**: Visit the utility page designed for this purpose: [Events to Unpublish](https://library.austintexas.gov/admin/events-to-unpublish).

2. **Select Expired Events**: On the page, you will find a list of events that are candidates for unpublishing. These are typically events that have already occurred and are no longer relevant.

3. **Batch Unpublish**: Select the events you wish to unpublish. You can do this individually or in a batch. Once selected, follow the prompts to unpublish these events.

4. **Verification**: After unpublishing, verify that these events are no longer appearing in the site's search results.

## Important Notes
- This process should be done regularly to ensure that expired events do not clutter the search results.
- The utility page is a temporary measure. Efforts are underway to automate this process for greater efficiency and accuracy.

## Conclusion
This manual process of unpublishing expired events is crucial for maintaining the relevance and usefulness of our site's search functionality. We appreciate your diligence in performing this task and welcome any suggestions for improvement.
